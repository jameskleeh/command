== Getting Started

1.In grails 3 add the following dependency to your gradle.build:
----
compile "org.grails.plugins:command:1.0.0"
----

2.Run grails create-command:
----
grails create-command >package>.<commandName>
----

or for the default package
----
grails create-command <commandName>
----

3.If this is the first command you've created run the refresh dependencies in Intellij, This will add the command
folder to the source set. Or you can manually add the folder to the source set, by right clicking on the folder
selecting "Mark Directory as" and selecting, "Sources Root". In a future release I'll look for a better way to
automate, and eliminate this step.
